  abstract = {The host microbiota may have an impact on pathogens. This is often studied in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like that of wild animals. In this study, we modified the gut microbiota of the insect Tenebrio molitor by rearing larvae in soil sampled from the field. We showed by high throughput sequencing methods that this treatment modifies the gut microbiota so that it is more diversified than that of laboratory-reared insects, and closely resembled the one of soil-dwelling insects. To describe what the entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus (Enterobacteriaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematode Steinernema, might experience in natural conditions, we studied the infestation of the soil-reared T. molitor larvae with three Steinernema--Xenorhabdus pairs. We performed the infestation at 18{$^\circ$}C, which delays the emergence of new infective juveniles (IJs), the soil-dwelling nematode forms, but which is a temperature compatible with natural infestation. We analyzed by high throughput sequencing methods the composition of the bacterial community within the insect cadavers before the first emergences of IJs. These bacterial communities were generally characterized by one or two non-symbiont taxa. Even for highly lethal Steinernema--Xenorhabdus pairs, the symbiont does not dominate the bacterial community within the insect cadaver.},

In the present study, we searched for molecular biomarkers of tree water status to develop next-generation biomonitoring of forest ecosystems. Because phyllosphere microbial communities respond to both tree physiology and climate change, we investigated whether environmental DNA data from tree phyllosphere could be used as molecular biomarkers of tree water status in forest ecosystems. Using an amplicon sequencing approach, we analysed phyllosphere microbial communities of four tree species (Quercus ilex, Quercus robur, Pinus pinaster and Betula pendula) in a forest experiment composed of irrigated and non-irrigated plots. We used these microbial community data to train a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest) to classify irrigated and non-irrigated trees. The Random Forest algorithm detected tree water status from phyllosphere microbial community composition with more than 90\% accuracy for oak species, and more than 75\% for pine and birch. Phyllosphere fungal communities were more informative than phyllosphere bacterial communities in all tree species. Seven fungal amplicon sequence variants were identified as candidates for the development of molecular biomarkers of water status in oak trees. Altogether, our results show that microbial community data from tree phyllosphere provides information on tree water status in forest ecosystems and could be included in next-generation biomonitoring programmes that would use in situ, real-time sequencing of environmental DNA to help monitor the health of European temperate forest ecosystems.},

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and there is uncertainty regarding which microbial taxa and functions are mostly involved. We explored these issues in Neotropical rainforests and identified foliar microorganisms that may play a role in drought tolerance of trees. Our objectives were to (i) test the relationship between drought tolerance traits in Neotropical trees and the diversity and composition of their foliar fungal and bacterial communities and (ii) identify leaf microbial taxa positively or negatively associated with drought tolerance traits. Our results showed that the composition of leaf fungal communities but not bacterial communities was related to drought tolerance. We identified 27 fungal amplicon sequence variants whose relative abundance covaried with drought tolerance traits. Most variants were assigned to fungal clades often described as plant pathogens and increased in abundance with drought susceptibility. This greater relative abundance of leaf pathogens in the most drought-susceptible trees might increase their vulnerability to climate change. Moreover, we identified the Strelitziana and Ochroconis fungal genera as potential candidates for future culture-dependent studies aimed at understanding and improving drought tolerance in Neotropical forests.

This impact is worsened by inter- kingdom insect-microbe interactions that can increase transmission and disease severity in affected plants. Whilst bacterial chemical cues have been shown to directly influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived compounds on phytopathogens is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the chemical basis for interactions between beetle larvae and bacteria in acute oak decline (AOD), a disease characterised by inner bark necrosis and involving a polymicrobial consortium including Brenneria goodwinii and larval galleries of Agrilus biguttatus. We found that A. biguttatus larval extracts contain chemical elicitors that increase bacterial growth rate and final cell density during in vitro culture, and stimulate the differential expression of {$\sim$}600 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, which are major virulence factors in plant pathogens. Chemical compounds from closely related insect species did not have this effect. These findings highlight the importance of inter-kingdom interactions in plant disease and suggests a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens.},

The use of microbial-based approaches and microbiome engineering to safeguard plants and crop production is promising, but their application in trees raises specific challenges. Here, we review knowledge on the tree microbiome and outline opportunities to leverage tree-associated microbial communities. We describe the specific challenges inherent to working with tree species and highlight how Synthetic Microbial Communities (SynComs) can be used to study and engineer tree microbiomes. Finally, we propose that future research priorities include (1) developing model tree systems for experimental work, (2) obtaining tree-specific culture collections and SynComs, and (3) optimising methods for tree SynCom inoculation. Unlocking these methodological challenges~will enable us to realise the potential of the tree microbiome and address global challenges in tree health and the provision of ecosystem services.},

Their functions range from mutualism to pathogenicity. All plant organs and tissues are generally colonized by bacterial endophytes and their diversity and composition depend on the plant, the plant organ and its physiological conditions, the plant growth stage as well as on the environment. Plant-associated microorganisms, and in particular endophytes, have lately received high attention, because of the increasing awareness of the importance of host-associated microbiota for the functioning and performance of their host. Some endophyte functions are known from mostly lab assays, genome prediction and few metagenome analyses; however, we have limited understanding on in planta activities, particularly considering the diversity of micro-environments and the dynamics of conditions. In our review, we present recent findings on endosphere environments, their physiological conditions and endophyte colonization. Furthermore, we discuss microbial functions, the interaction between endophytes and plants as well as methodological limitations of endophyte research. We also provide an outlook on needs of future research to improve our understanding on the role of microbiota colonizing the endosphere on plant traits and ecosystem functioning.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of the eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems on the skin microbiota of fish. We sampled wild gudgeon Gobio occitaniae from 17 river sites along an eutrophication gradient and compared their skin microbiota diversity and composition, using a 16s~rRNA gene metabarcoding approach. Results showed a tendency for higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in highly eutrophic sites linked to the presence of suspended organic matters. We also highlighted significant links between eutrophication and skin microbiota taxonomic composition and beta-diversity. In contrast, skin microbiota characteristics did not correlate with host factors such as age or sex, although microbiota beta-diversity did vary significantly according to host parasite load. To conclude, our study highlights the importance of environmental factors, especially eutrophication, on the diversity and composition of skin mucus bacterial communities. Because changes in the skin microbiota may induce potential deleterious consequences on host health and population persistence, our results confirm the importance of accounting for host-microbiota interactions when examining the consequences of anthropogenic activities on aquatic fauna.},

  abstract = {Biomonitoring ecosystems is necessary in order to evaluate risks and to efficiently manage ecosystems and their associated services. Agrosystems are the target of multiple stressors that can affect many species through effects cascading along food webs. However, classic biomonitoring, focused on species diversity or indicator species, might be a poor predictor of the risk of such whole-ecosystem perturbations. Thanks to high-throughput sequencing methods, however, it might be possible to obtain sufficient information about entire ecological communities to infer the functioning of their associated interaction networks, and thus monitor more closely the risk of the collapse of entire food webs due to external stressors. In the course of the `next-generation biomonitoring' project, we collectively sought to experiment with this idea of inferring ecological networks on the basis of metabarcoding information gathered on different systems. We here give an overview of issues and preliminary results associated with this endeavour and highlight the main difficulties that such next-generation biomonitoring is still facing. Going from sampling protocols up to methods for comparing inferred networks, through biomolecular, bioinformatic, and network inference, we review all steps of the process, with a view towards generality and transferability towards other systems.},

Here, we tested two isolation methods, (i) agar plating and (ii) dilution-to-extinction, for isolation of microbiota from leaf, stem, and root/rhizosphere tissues of oak trees. Microbial isolates obtained (culture-dependent) and the endogenous oak microbiota of the source tissue samples (culture-independent) were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS community profiling. We found that the type of growth medium, incubation conditions, and sample type inoculated onto agar influenced the number of isolates and taxonomic richness of the isolates obtained. Most bacterial and fungal ASVs obtained from isolation-based approaches were only obtained using one of the two isolation methods, with only 12\% of the ASVs detected in both. Moreover, the isolation methods captured microorganisms not detected by culture-independent analysis of the microbiota, suggesting these approaches can complement culture-independent analysis by enriching low-abundant taxa. Our results suggest that dilution-to-extinction and agar-plating approaches captured distinct fractions of the oak microbiota, and that a combination of both isolation methods was required to produce taxonomically richer microbial culture collections.},

The aim of this study was to determine the role of Dam DNA methylation in P. luminescens during the whole bacterial life cycle including during symbiosis with H. bacteriophora. We constructed a strain overexpressing dam by inserting an additional copy of the dam gene under the control of a constitutive promoter in the chromosome of P. luminescens and then achieved association between this recombinant strain and nematodes. The dam overexpressing strain was able to feed the nematode in vitro and in vivo similarly as a control strain, and to re-associate with Infective Juvenile (IJ) stages in the insect. No difference in the amount of emerging IJs from the cadaver was observed between the two strains. Compared to the nematode in symbiosis with the control strain, a significant increase in LT50 was observed during insect infestation with the nematode associated with the dam overexpressing strain. These results suggest that during the life cycle of P. luminescens, Dam is not involved the bacterial symbiosis with the nematode H. bacteriophora, but it contributes to the pathogenicity of the nemato-bacterial complex.},
